    /**
     * The same material model as Drucker Prager, but this one supports multiple
     * compositions.
     *
     * The model is considered incompressible, following the definition
     * described in Interface::is_compressible.
     *
     * The viscosity is computed according to the Drucker Prager frictional
     * plasticity criterion based on a user-defined internal angle of friction $\phi$
     * and cohesion $C$. In 3D:
     * $\sigma_y = \frac{6 C \cos(\phi)}{\sqrt(3) (3+\sin(\phi))} +
     * \frac{6 P \sin(\phi)}{\sqrt(3) (3+\sin(\phi))}$,
     * where $P$ is the pressure.
     * See for example Zienkiewicz, O. C., Humpheson, C. and Lewis, R. W. (1975),
     * G&eacute;otechnique 25, No. 4, 671-689.
     * With this formulation we circumscribe instead of inscribe the Mohr Coulomb
     * yield surface.
     * In 2D the Drucker Prager yield surface is the same
     * as the Mohr Coulomb surface:
     * $\sigma_y = P \sin(\phi) + C \cos(\phi)$.
     * Note that in 2D for $\phi=0$, these criteria
     * revert to the von Mises criterion (no pressure dependence).
     * See for example Thieulot, C. (2011), PEPI 188, 47-68.
     *
     * Note that we enforce the pressure to be positive in the computation of
     * the yield strength by replacing it with
     * a zero value whenever it is negative to prevent negative
     * yield strengths and viscosities.
     * We then use the computed yield strength to scale back the viscosity on
     * to the yield surface using the Viscosity Rescaling Method described in
     * Kachanov, L. M. (2004), Fundamentals of the Theory of Plasticity,
     * Dover Publications, Inc.
     *
     * To avoid numerically unfavourably large (or even negative) viscosity ranges,
     * we cut off the viscosity with a user-defined minimum and maximum viscosity:
     * $\eta_eff = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{\eta_min + \eta}+\\
     * \frac{1}{\eta_max}}$.
     *
     * Note that this model uses the formulation that assumes an incompressible
     * medium despite the fact that the density follows the law
     * $\rho(T)=\rho_0(1-\beta(T-T_{\text{ref}}))$.
     *
